## 🎯 Overview

SignScribe is a state-of-the-art American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system that converts hand gestures into text in real-time. Unlike traditional image-based approaches, SignScribe uses **MediaPipe hand landmarks** combined with a **Random Forest classifier** to achieve superior accuracy and performance.

### Key Innovations:
- **Landmark-Based Recognition**: Processes 21 3D hand landmarks instead of raw pixels for better accuracy and speed
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for live camera feed with minimal latency
- **Intelligent Smoothing**: Advanced prediction stabilization prevents character spam
- **Professional UI**: Modern dark-themed interface with custom-drawn components

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **High Accuracy**: 95%+ accuracy on ASL alphabet recognition
- ⚡ **Real-Time Performance**: 30+ FPS processing with minimal CPU usage
- 🧠 **Smart Prediction Smoothing**: 5-frame window with majority voting
- ⏱️ **Configurable Cooldown**: 5-second delay between character inputs to prevent spam
- 🎨 **Professional UI**: Custom dark theme with glowing prediction display
- 📱 **Lightweight Model**: Uses Random Forest instead of heavy CNN models
- 🔄 **Robust Preprocessing**: Translation and scale-invariant landmark normalization
- 📝 **Sentence Building**: Build complete sentences with space, delete, and backspace functionality

```

### Data Flow:
1. **Camera Capture**: Real-time video feed from webcam
2. **Hand Detection**: MediaPipe identifies hand regions and extracts 21 landmarks
3. **Normalization**: Landmarks are made translation and scale-invariant
4. **Classification**: Random Forest model predicts ASL letter
5. **Smoothing**: 5-frame majority voting prevents false positives
6. **Output**: Stable predictions are added to sentence

## 💻 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Webcam/Camera
- 4GB+ RAM recommended

### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/American-sign-language-detection.git
cd American-sign-language-detection
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pandas numpy scikit-learn pillow matplotlib seaborn
```

### Step 3: Train the Model
```bash
# Extract landmarks from training images
cd utils
python extract_landmarks.py

# Train the Random Forest classifier  
cd ../models
python train_classifier.py
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
```bash
cd ../ui
python app.py
```

## 📖 Usage

### Starting the Application
1. Launch the application: `python ui/app.py`
2. Click **"▶ Start Camera"** to begin real-time recognition
3. Show your hand to the camera and make ASL signs
4. Watch predictions appear in the **RECOGNITION** panel
5. Stable predictions automatically build your sentence

### Controls
- **Start/Stop Camera**: Control camera feed
- **Clear**: Remove all text from sentence
- **Backspace**: Delete last character
- **Special Signs**:
  - Sign 'space' for word separation
  - Sign 'del' for backspace action

### Tips for Best Results
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Keep hand clearly visible in camera frame
- Hold each sign steady for ~1 second
- Wait for 5-second cooldown between letters
